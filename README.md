# FAC Application Website

This is my Application Website for the January 2022 Cohort of [Founders and Coders (FAC)](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/).  

FAC is a UK-based nonprofit that develops and runs tuition-free, peer-led training programmes in web development. 

## Website Requirements
One of the requirements to apply for the programme is to build an application website that:

* tells FAC about yourself,
* tells why you are applying for the programme,
* demonstrates your capabilities in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries).
  
It must also have at least one example of each of these:

* Semantic HTML5 elements
* CSS grid or flexbox layout (or both)
* DOM event listeners for user interaction
* DOM updates in response to user interaction 

## My Application
In this application website, I used: 
- [x] semantic HTML elements, as much as possible, to create an accessible user experience,
- [x] a CSS grid to create the “maze” on the “projects” page and CSS flexbox layout to position the elements on the landing and “about” pages,
- [x] event listeners for user interaction on the “projects” page, where the user can click on an element to see the description of each project, and
- [x] a quiz feature, with the help of a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) to explain why I’m applying to FAC in a fun, engaging, and interactive way. 

## Some Sources of Inspiration 
* Minimalist pastel aesthetic, which I find visually pleasing.
* Girl Power cartoons like [The Powerpuff Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Powerpuff_Girls).
* Ximena Vengoechea's [personal website](https://www.ximenavengoechea.com/).
